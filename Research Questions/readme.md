### Research Questions
1. Do students with an Economics major have greater levels of financial literacy (i.e., saving more/spending less)?
2. For students receiving financial aid, are those with less total financial aid more financially literate?
3. Does a student's college year affect spending habits (e.g., do upperclassmen spend more than underclassmen on leisure such as entertainment)?
